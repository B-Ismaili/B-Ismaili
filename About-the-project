Im not sure if i did the database setup right, but when i have to acces it i have to go manualy  by writing on the (in my case) Chrome localhost:8080/Project/process.php, when i try it i have the registrations data.
I spended a lot of time trying to figure it out, and i enjoyed every second of it and thats why i tried till the end of the given time.
